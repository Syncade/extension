Bring your own website into Framer with a few clicks. Simply copy and paste web elements and edit them directly in Framer.

Once you have installed the extension, simply hover over any element such as text, images, buttons, or entire layouts. Click to copy, then go to Framer and press âŒ˜V (or Ctrl V on Windows) to paste. Your elements will be pasted with a clean layer hierarchy, ready to be further edited or published immediately within Framer. Pro tip: Hold Shift to copy multiple items for even greater speed. To select a parent element of a site item, press Esc while hovering over it.
